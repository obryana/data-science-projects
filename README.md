##Logistic Regression Analysis on Heart Disease Prediction
       *Using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I performed a logistic regression to predict the probability of   heart disease given various key biomarkers. I balanced the training data using SMOTE oversampling and implemented PCA to account for multicollinearity among the predictors. *
  
##Social Network Algorithmic Influence on Radicalization
       *With the aid of trending video data scraped from YouTube, I employ natural language processing sentiment analysis to categorize videos and comments into extremist sub-genres (e.g. white supremacy, conspiracy theory). I will use this labelled dataset to estimate the number of videos watched on auto play (on an account with no prior user information) before such a video is encountered.*

##Google FooBar Coding Challenge
       *I completed the Google foobar invitation-only coding challenges using Python. One of these timed challenges required performing matrix calculations without the aid of prebuilt libraries to arrive at the probabilities of various terminal states given an input matrix of state transition possibilities. I implemented this solution using absorbing Markov chains.*

##NLP Classifier for UK Coffee Shops
       *I used a set of UK retail locations and associated category labels to build a natural language processing procedure for finding a solution to heuristic labelling. I created a set of n-grams with the corpus of data and implemented a TF-IDF vectorizer to downweigh commonly used words. I split the data into testing and training sets and performed cross-validation using k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and ridge classifiers.*
